"PromptSource" is an integrated development environment and repository designed for creating, sharing, and using natural language prompts, particularly in the context of zero-shot and few-shot learning in NLP. The system addresses challenges in prompt engineering by offering a templating language for defining data-linked prompts, an interface for prompt development, and community-driven guidelines for contributing new prompts. It supports the creation of over 2,000 prompts for approximately 170 datasets, facilitating the adaptation of language models to ad-hoc tasks and improving sample efficiency. PromptSource integrates with the HuggingFace Datasets library, allowing users to load datasets, browse existing prompts, and create new ones. The design of PromptSource includes a flexible templating language using Jinja2, tools for prompt management, and a set of quality standards. The system's workflow involves exploring datasets, writing and documenting prompts, iterating on prompt construction, and conducting global reviews. PromptSource supports research in prompting by providing a standardized platform for prompt creation and has been instrumental in projects involving massively multitask prompted training, multilingual prompting, and priming. The system's community guidelines ensure prompts are written in natural language and encourage diversity in prompt formulation to enhance model robustness. PromptSource is part of the BigScience project, aiming to study large language models in a collaborative and open research environment.
