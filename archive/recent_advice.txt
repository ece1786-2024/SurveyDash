## Feedback on Revised Outline

### General Feedback

Your outline demonstrates a clear understanding of the thematic sections necessary for a comprehensive survey on LLM applications in legal texts. However, there are areas where you can enhance the structure and content to ensure a more cohesive and insightful paper. Below are specific suggestions for each section:

### 1. Introduction

- **Content Structure:** 
  - While you have a good start, ensure that the introduction not only highlights the importance of LLMs in legal contexts but also succinctly outlines the specific challenges and opportunities they present. This will set a strong foundation for the rest of the paper.
  - Clarify the scope of the survey and the criteria for selecting the core and related papers. This will help readers understand the focus and limitations of your review.

### 2. Domain-Specific LLMs for Legal Texts

- **Content Structure:**
  - When discussing AraLegal-BERT and other models, provide more context on why domain-specific adaptations are necessary. What unique challenges do legal texts present that general LLMs struggle with?
  - The comparison between domain-specific models and general LLMs should be more detailed. Highlight specific performance metrics or case studies that illustrate the advantages or limitations of each approach.
  - Ensure that the identification of research gaps is based on the analysis of the core papers. This will provide a solid basis for your conclusions and recommendations.

### 3. Multilingual and Cross-Lingual Capabilities

- **Content Structure:**
  - Expand on the specific legal tasks where multilingual models like BLOOM and mT5 excel. Are there particular languages or legal systems where these models perform better or worse?
  - Discuss the implications of cross-lingual generalization in more depth. How does this capability impact legal practitioners or the accessibility of legal information across different jurisdictions?
  - Address any unresolved issues or challenges that multilingual models face in the legal domain, such as cultural nuances or legal terminology differences.

### 4. Legal Reasoning and Societal Values in LLMs

- **Content Structure:**
  - Provide a clearer explanation of the "Law Informs Code" approach. How does this methodology practically align AI behavior with human values, and what are its limitations?
  - When discussing the challenges of embedding legal reasoning, consider including examples or case studies that illustrate these difficulties.
  - Suggest potential frameworks or methodologies for integrating legal standards into AI systems, drawing from the core papers.

### 5. Future Directions and Ethical Considerations

- **Content Structure:**
  - Clearly articulate the open challenges and research gaps, ensuring they are directly linked to the findings from the core papers.
  - The discussion on ethical considerations should be more comprehensive. Consider including issues like data privacy, accountability, and the potential for misuse of LLMs in legal contexts.
  - Provide actionable recommendations for future research and practice, grounded in the insights gained from the survey.

### 6. Conclusion

- **Content Structure:**
  - Ensure that the conclusion not only summarizes the key findings but also reflects on the broader implications of LLMs in the legal domain.
  - Consider ending with a call to action or a vision for the future, emphasizing the potential impact of LLMs on legal practice and society.

### Cohesion Across Sections

- Ensure that each section transitions smoothly into the next. Use connecting sentences or paragraphs to highlight how the insights from one section inform the discussions in the subsequent sections.
- Consider creating a visual roadmap or diagram to illustrate the connections between sections and the overall narrative of the survey.

By addressing these suggestions, you will enhance the clarity, coherence, and depth of your survey paper, providing a valuable resource for understanding the applications of LLMs in legal texts.
