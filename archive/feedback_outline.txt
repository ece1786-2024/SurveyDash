## Feedback

Your outline demonstrates a good understanding of the thematic sections necessary for a survey paper on LLM applications in legal texts. However, there are several areas where improvements are needed to meet the high standards expected:

1. **Clarity and Specificity:** While you have identified core and related papers for each section, your outline lacks specificity in how each paper contributes to the section's theme. Ensure that you provide a concise summary of each paper's contributions and clearly articulate how they relate to the main idea of the section.

2. **Comparisons and Contrasts:** You mention comparing and contrasting papers, but your outline does not provide specific points of comparison. Highlight key differences and similarities in methodologies, findings, or perspectives among the papers.

3. **Gaps and Unresolved Issues:** Your outline should more explicitly identify gaps or unresolved issues in the literature. This will help in highlighting the significance of the survey and guiding future research directions.

4. **Cohesion Across Sections:** While you have noted how sections connect, these connections need to be more explicit and logical. Ensure that each section builds on the previous one, creating a cohesive narrative that guides the reader through the survey.

5. **Ethical Considerations:** The section on challenges and ethical considerations is crucial. Make sure to delve deeper into these aspects, as they are particularly important in the context of legal applications.

6. **Conclusion and Future Directions:** This section should not only summarize the findings but also critically reflect on the implications of these findings for the field. Suggest concrete future research directions based on the gaps identified.

By addressing these points, you will enhance the clarity, coherence, and depth of your survey paper. I look forward to seeing your revised outline.
