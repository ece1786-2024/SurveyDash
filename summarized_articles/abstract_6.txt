The paper "Towards WinoQueer: Developing a Benchmark for Anti-Queer Bias in Large Language Models" explores the presence of biases against queer and trans individuals in large language models (LLMs) like BERT. The authors introduce WinoQueer, a new benchmark dataset specifically designed to detect homophobic and transphobic biases in LLMs. They found that BERT exhibits significant anti-queer bias, which can be mitigated by fine-tuning the model on data from the LGBTQ+ community. The study also hypothesizes that models trained on data written by queer individuals perform better in reducing bias compared to those trained on mainstream media. The paper discusses related work in AI bias, highlighting a lack of focus on anti-queer biases in existing literature. The methodology includes collecting data from LGBTQ+ social media and news articles, creating the WinoQueer dataset with templates addressing specific stereotypes, and fine-tuning models on this data. The results show that fine-tuning on queer data reduces bias in BERT, with Twitter data being slightly more effective than news data. The study also evaluates the models on coreference resolution tasks, finding minimal performance degradation, but an unexpected increase in gender disparity bias. The paper concludes by emphasizing the need for more comprehensive benchmarks and further exploration of biases in LLMs.
