The paper "Towards WinoQueer: Developing a Benchmark for Anti-Queer Bias in Large Language Models" investigates biases against queer and trans individuals in large language models (LLMs) like BERT. The authors introduce WinoQueer, a benchmark dataset to measure homophobic and transphobic biases, and propose reducing these biases by fine-tuning models on data written by or about queer people. The study highlights the lack of focus on queer biases in existing NLP research, which predominantly addresses race and binary gender biases. The authors collected data from social media and news sources to create a corpus for fine-tuning models. WinoQueer is designed to explore identity-specific biases within the LGBTQ+ community and includes pronouns like they/them and neopronouns. The study finds significant homophobic bias in BERT, which can be mitigated by fine-tuning on queer-authored content, with QueerTwitter data showing slightly better results than QueerNews. The models were also evaluated on coreference resolution tasks to ensure that fine-tuning did not degrade performance on downstream tasks. While fine-tuning reduced anti-queer bias, it did not significantly improve gender bias, indicating further research is needed. The paper concludes with the potential for future work to expand the WinoQueer benchmark and test more LLMs.
