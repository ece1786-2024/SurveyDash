The paper "State of the Art in Artificial Intelligence applied to the Legal Domain" provides a comprehensive overview of the application of AI, particularly Natural Language Processing (NLP), to the legal field. It highlights the complexity of legal systems and the challenges faced by citizens in accessing and understanding legal texts due to the specialized language used. The paper discusses two main AI approaches: Logic-based, which focuses on formalizing legal texts into logical expressions, and Data-centric, which uses machine learning to automate legal text processing. It explores various representation languages and ontologies for legal texts, such as LKIF, Legal-URN, and LegalRuleML, which aim to standardize legal knowledge representation. The paper also reviews existing AI-based legal tools like Menslegis/Eunomos and traditional legal information retrieval methods, emphasizing the need for NLP advancements to improve legal information access. Recent deep learning models like BERT and GPT-3 are discussed for their potential in enhancing NLP tasks in the legal domain. The paper concludes by suggesting that recent NLP advancements, particularly those involving semantic information extraction and weakly-supervised learning, can significantly improve legal information retrieval systems, making legal texts more accessible and understandable to the general public.
