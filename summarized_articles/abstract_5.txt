The paper "State of the Art in Artificial Intelligence applied to the Legal Domain" provides a comprehensive overview of how Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Natural Language Processing (NLP), is revolutionizing the legal domain. It begins by discussing the challenges faced by citizens in accessing legal information due to the complex language of legal texts and the potential of AI to overcome these barriers. The paper outlines two traditional AI approaches in law: Logic-based, which involves formalizing legal texts into logical expressions, and Data-centric, which uses machine learning to automate the interpretation of legal texts. It also reviews various representation languages and ontologies like LKIF, Legal-URN, and LegalRuleML, which aim to standardize legal text representation. The paper highlights recent advances in deep learning, such as transformer-based models like BERT and GPT-3, which have significantly improved NLP tasks. It discusses Semantic Representation Languages and their role in enhancing information retrieval and norm extraction in legal texts. The paper also explores current AI-based legal tools and traditional approaches to Legal Information Retrieval, emphasizing the importance of semantic NLP in improving access to legal information. Finally, it concludes by suggesting that recent NLP advancements can bridge the gap in legal information access, proposing a Proactive Legal Information Retrieval system to make legal texts more accessible and relevant to users.
