The paper introduces BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a novel language representation model that pre-trains deep bidirectional representations by conditioning on both left and right context, unlike previous models which use unidirectional context. BERT's architecture is based on a multi-layer bidirectional Transformer encoder, and it employs a masked language model (MLM) and next sentence prediction (NSP) tasks during pre-training to enable deep bidirectional learning. This approach allows BERT to achieve state-of-the-art results on a wide range of NLP tasks, including question answering and language inference, without requiring substantial task-specific modifications. The model's effectiveness is demonstrated through experiments on the GLUE benchmark, SQuAD datasets, and the SWAG dataset, where BERT consistently outperforms existing models. The paper also discusses the impact of model size and the benefits of bidirectional pre-training, showing that larger models lead to better performance across tasks. Additionally, BERT is effective for both fine-tuning and feature-based approaches, making it versatile for various NLP applications. The research highlights the importance of bidirectional pre-training and sets a new standard for language model transfer learning.
