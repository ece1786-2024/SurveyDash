The paper introduces BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a novel language representation model designed to pretrain deep bidirectional representations by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. Unlike previous models, BERT uses a masked language model (MLM) and next sentence prediction (NSP) for pretraining, enabling the creation of state-of-the-art models for various tasks without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT achieves new state-of-the-art results on eleven NLP tasks, significantly improving benchmarks such as the GLUE score and SQuAD. The paper details BERT's architecture, which is based on a multi-layer bidirectional Transformer encoder, and describes its pre-training on BooksCorpus and English Wikipedia using MLM and NSP tasks. Fine-tuning BERT for specific tasks is straightforward, leveraging its self-attention mechanism to handle both single text and text pair tasks. Experiments demonstrate BERT's superior performance across multiple benchmarks, including GLUE, SQuAD, and SWAG, with ablation studies highlighting the importance of bidirectional pre-training and model size. The paper also compares BERT's fine-tuning and feature-based approaches, showing its effectiveness in both scenarios. Overall, BERT's bidirectional architecture and pre-training strategy mark a significant advancement in language model pre-training, allowing for robust performance across a wide range of NLP tasks.
