"PromptSource" is an integrated development environment and repository designed for creating, sharing, and using natural language prompts, particularly in zero- and few-shot learning settings in NLP. The system provides a templating language for defining data-linked prompts, a user-friendly interface for prompt development, and community-driven guidelines for contributing prompts. It hosts over 2,000 prompts for approximately 170 datasets, facilitating collaborative prompt engineering. The system is built on recent advancements in prompt engineering and is integrated with the HuggingFace Datasets library, allowing users to load datasets, browse existing prompts, and create new ones. PromptSource emphasizes three key design aspects: a flexible templating language, tools for prompt management, and community-driven quality standards. The templating language, based on Jinja2, balances expressivity and structure, allowing users to create prompts using dataset fields and simple logic. The system's UI supports prompt creation, iteration, and verification through three views: Browse, Sourcing, and Helicopter. Community guidelines ensure prompt quality and standardization, encouraging diversity in prompt formulation to enhance model robustness. PromptSource has been pivotal in several research projects, including multilingual prompting and priming in-context learning. It represents a significant step towards supporting the growing field of prompt engineering, offering a centralized tool for collaborative research and development.
