The paper explores the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) for topic classification in public affairs documents, which are crucial for transparency and informed decision-making. The study leverages a dataset of over 33,000 Spanish public affairs documents, annotated with 30 frequent topics, derived from a larger corpus of 450,000 legislative initiatives. The authors focus on multi-label classification using four Spanish LLMs, including RoBERTa and GPT2, combined with classifiers like SVMs and Random Forests. The methodology involves breaking down the classification task into binary detection tasks for each topic, utilizing a transformer-based model as the backbone. Experiments reveal that RoBERTa-base models paired with SVM classifiers achieve high accuracy, particularly for topics with limited samples. The study highlights the potential of LLMs in enhancing document analysis in public affairs, suggesting future work on addressing data imbalances and exploring more advanced LLMs and NLP tasks.
