The paper "Attention Is All You Need" introduces the Transformer, a novel neural network architecture for sequence transduction tasks, such as language translation, that relies entirely on attention mechanisms, eliminating the need for recurrent or convolutional networks. The Transformer architecture is based on self-attention and point-wise, fully connected layers, allowing for greater parallelization and reduced training time. It achieves superior performance on translation tasks, setting new state-of-the-art BLEU scores on the WMT 2014 English-to-German and English-to-French tasks, while requiring significantly less training time compared to previous models. The model's architecture includes an encoder-decoder structure, with both the encoder and decoder consisting of stacked layers of multi-head self-attention and feed-forward networks. The paper details the mechanisms of scaled dot-product attention and multi-head attention, which allow the model to attend to different representation subspaces. Positional encoding is used to provide information about the order of the sequence, as the model does not inherently capture sequence order due to the absence of recurrence. The paper also compares the computational efficiency and path length of self-attention layers to recurrent and convolutional layers, highlighting the advantages of self-attention in learning long-range dependencies. The Transformer demonstrates its generalization capabilities by performing well on English constituency parsing tasks. The authors conclude by emphasizing the potential of attention-based models and suggest future research directions, including applications to other modalities and less sequential generation processes. The paper provides a link to the code used for training and evaluation.
