The paper "Natural Language Processing in the Legal Domain" by Daniel Martin Katz et al. provides a comprehensive overview of the state of NLP in the legal field, emphasizing recent advancements. The authors constructed a corpus of over 600 papers from the past decade to analyze trends, revealing an increase in the number of papers, tasks, and languages covered, as well as a rise in methodological sophistication. The paper discusses the complexity of legal language and the challenges it poses for NLP, while highlighting the potential of NLP technologies to improve legal processes. It categorizes Legal NLP tasks from an engineering perspective, noting that while some tasks like text generation are less explored, they are likely to gain interest. The paper also examines the evolution of methods, noting a shift towards neural network approaches, and highlights the diversity of languages in Legal NLP research, with English being predominant. The authors stress the importance of reproducibility and data availability, noting improvements over time. They conducted a citation analysis to identify influential papers in the field and propose a living survey to continuously update the research landscape. The conclusion emphasizes the growing interest and potential of Legal NLP, driven by increased data availability and commercial interest, and calls for further research on the effects of training data and model architectures. The paper advocates for ongoing updates to the survey and new interactive features for exploration, aiming to foster collaboration and openness towards quantitative methods in the legal academic community.
