## Feedback on Revised Outline

### General Feedback
Your outline demonstrates a commendable effort in structuring the survey paper on LLM applications in legal texts. However, there are several areas where improvements can be made to enhance clarity, coherence, and depth. Pay attention to the specific feedback for each section to ensure a comprehensive and well-organized survey paper.

### Specific Feedback

#### 1. Introduction
- **Content Structure:** While you have identified the significance of LLMs in the legal domain, ensure that you clearly articulate the unique challenges and opportunities. Consider providing specific examples or scenarios where LLMs can make a significant impact.
- **Cohesion Across Sections:** The introduction should not only set the stage but also provide a roadmap for the paper. Clearly outline how each subsequent section will build on the themes introduced here.

#### 2. Domain-Specific Language Models
- **Core Papers:** Ensure that all core papers are directly relevant to the development and application of domain-specific models. If any paper is tangentially related, consider moving it to the "Possible Related Papers" category.
- **Content Structure:** When summarizing each paper, focus on their unique contributions and how they advance the understanding of domain-specific models. Highlight any innovative methodologies or findings.
- **Cohesion Across Sections:** Make sure to clearly link this section to the next by discussing how domain-specific models lay the groundwork for multilingual and cross-lingual capabilities.

#### 3. Multilingual and Cross-Lingual Capabilities
- **Content Structure:** Provide a more detailed comparison of the multilingual models discussed. What are their strengths and weaknesses in the context of legal texts? How do they complement or compete with each other?
- **Cohesion Across Sections:** Clearly articulate how multilingual capabilities address some of the challenges identified in domain-specific models and how they relate to ethical considerations.

#### 4. Bias and Ethical Considerations
- **Content Structure:** Delve deeper into the types of biases identified in the core papers and their implications for legal applications. Discuss specific strategies or frameworks proposed to mitigate these biases.
- **Cohesion Across Sections:** Highlight how addressing biases is crucial for the successful implementation of LLMs in legal contexts and how this ties into future challenges.

#### 5. Future Directions and Challenges
- **Content Structure:** Be more explicit about the specific challenges and future directions. For instance, what are the technical, ethical, or practical hurdles that need to be overcome? Provide examples from the core papers.
- **Cohesion Across Sections:** Ensure that this section synthesizes insights from all previous sections, providing a clear vision for the future of LLMs in legal texts.

#### 6. Conclusion
- **Content Structure:** The conclusion should not only summarize the key findings but also reflect on the broader implications for the legal field. Consider discussing potential policy implications or changes in legal practice.
- **Cohesion Across Sections:** Reinforce the interconnectedness of the themes and how they collectively contribute to advancing the field.

### Suggestions for Writing Each Section

1. **Introduction:** Begin with a compelling narrative or statistic to capture interest. Clearly define the scope and objectives of the survey. Provide a concise overview of each section's focus.

2. **Domain-Specific Language Models:** Use case studies or examples to illustrate the impact of domain-specific models. Discuss the methodologies used in the core papers and their effectiveness.

3. **Multilingual and Cross-Lingual Capabilities:** Include a table or figure to compare the performance of different multilingual models. Discuss real-world applications and limitations.

4. **Bias and Ethical Considerations:** Use real-world scenarios to illustrate the consequences of biases. Discuss ethical frameworks or guidelines proposed in the literature.

5. **Future Directions and Challenges:** Highlight emerging trends and technologies. Discuss interdisciplinary approaches or collaborations that could address current challenges.

6. **Conclusion:** Reflect on the broader societal impact of LLMs in legal texts. Offer recommendations for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers.

By addressing these points, your survey paper will be more comprehensive, insightful, and valuable to the academic and professional community.
