## Introduction

The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has marked a transformative era in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), offering unprecedented capabilities in understanding and generating human language. These models, exemplified by architectures such as BERT [4] and its derivatives, have demonstrated remarkable proficiency across a wide array of linguistic tasks. However, the application of LLMs in domain-specific contexts, particularly in the legal domain, presents unique challenges and opportunities that are yet to be fully explored.

Legal texts are characterized by their complexity, specialized vocabulary, and the necessity for precise interpretation, which often pose significant hurdles for general-purpose LLMs. As such, there is a growing interest in developing domain-specific adaptations of these models to enhance their applicability and effectiveness in legal contexts. For instance, AraLegal-BERT [1] represents a tailored approach to leveraging BERT for Arabic legal texts, showcasing the potential of customized LLMs in improving the accuracy and relevance of legal text analysis. AraLegal-BERT is a bidirectional encoder Transformer-based model that has been fine-tuned on legal datasets to improve its performance on tasks such as jurisprudence analysis, legal document classification, and legal practice applications. The customization of AraLegal-BERT involves training the model from scratch using domain-relevant datasets, which allows it to outperform general-purpose BERT models in accuracy and relevance when applied to legal texts [1].

The importance of LLMs in the legal domain extends beyond mere text analysis. They hold the potential to revolutionize legal practice by automating routine tasks, improving access to legal information, and supporting decision-making processes. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of LLM applications in legal texts, highlighting key advancements, challenges, and future directions.

In recent years, there has been a notable increase in research focused on Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP), which utilizes NLP techniques to predict judicial outcomes based on factual descriptions [3]. This surge in interest is fueled by the availability of large-scale datasets and the continuous evolution of NLP methodologies. Despite the progress made, a significant gap remains between machine and human performance, underscoring the need for further exploration and refinement of LLMs in this domain.

Moreover, the integration of legal reasoning and societal values into LLMs is a critical area of research that seeks to align AI behavior with human goals. The "Law Informs Code" approach [9] exemplifies efforts to embed legal knowledge and reasoning within AI systems, thereby enhancing their alignment with societal values and ethical standards.

This survey will delve into the various facets of LLM applications in legal texts, structured as follows: an exploration of domain-specific LLMs tailored for legal texts, an examination of multilingual and cross-lingual capabilities, an investigation into the incorporation of legal reasoning and societal values, and a discussion on future directions and ethical considerations. By synthesizing insights from core papers [1, 3, 5, 7] and related works [9, 10, 13], this paper aims to provide a valuable resource for both NLP researchers and legal professionals, fostering further collaboration and innovation in this burgeoning field.
