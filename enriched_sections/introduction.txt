The application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the legal domain represents a significant advancement in the intersection of artificial intelligence and law. As the legal field is characterized by its complexity, precision, and reliance on extensive textual data, the integration of LLMs offers unique opportunities to enhance legal text analysis, streamline legal processes, and improve access to justice. The growing interest in applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to legal texts is driven by the potential of LLMs to transform traditional legal practices through automation and improved accuracy in legal document analysis [1, 3, 5, 7].

LLMs, such as BERT and its domain-specific variants, have demonstrated remarkable success in various NLP tasks, including text classification, sentiment analysis, and language translation [4]. However, the legal domain presents distinct challenges that necessitate specialized adaptations of these models. Legal texts are often characterized by complex language, domain-specific terminology, and jurisdictional variations, which require models to be finely tuned to capture the nuances of legal language [1, 3]. The development of domain-specific models, such as AraLegal-BERT, highlights the importance of customizing LLMs to address the specific needs of legal text analysis [1].

The potential of LLMs to revolutionize legal text analysis is immense, yet it is accompanied by challenges that must be addressed to fully realize their benefits. These challenges include the need for domain-specific training data, the handling of multilingual legal systems, and the mitigation of biases inherent in language models [3, 5, 7]. Moreover, the ethical implications of deploying LLMs in legal contexts, particularly concerning fairness and transparency, are critical considerations that must be addressed to ensure just outcomes [6, 9].

This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of LLM applications in legal texts, exploring the advancements, challenges, and future directions in this rapidly evolving field. The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 delves into the development and application of domain-specific language models tailored for legal texts. Section 3 examines the role of multilingual and cross-lingual capabilities in legal text analysis. Section 4 addresses the ethical considerations and biases present in LLMs when applied to legal texts. Finally, Section 5 outlines the future research directions and challenges in this domain, while Section 6 concludes with a reflection on the broader implications for the legal field.

By systematically exploring these themes, this survey seeks to illuminate the transformative potential of LLMs in the legal domain and provide insights into the ongoing efforts to enhance their applicability and effectiveness. Through this exploration, we aim to facilitate further research and collaboration between NLP researchers and legal professionals, ultimately contributing to the advancement of legal technology and the improvement of legal services.
