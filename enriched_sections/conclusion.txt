In this survey, we have explored the transformative potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the legal domain, highlighting their significant impact on legal text analysis and practice. The survey has delved into various aspects of LLM applications, including domain-specific adaptations, multilingual capabilities, legal reasoning, and ethical considerations. Through the examination of core papers and related works, several key insights and future directions have emerged.

Firstly, the development of domain-specific LLMs, such as AraLegal-BERT, demonstrates the necessity of tailoring models to handle the unique challenges presented by legal texts, including complex terminologies and jurisdiction-specific nuances [1]. AraLegal-BERT, a bidirectional encoder Transformer-based model, has been fine-tuned and optimized specifically for Arabic legal texts, showcasing improved accuracy over general-purpose BERT models in legal applications. This underscores the importance of customization in achieving accurate and reliable results in legal applications [1; 3].

Secondly, the survey highlights the growing importance of multilingual and cross-lingual capabilities in legal text analysis. Models like BLOOM and mT5 have shown promise in handling legal tasks across different languages, thereby enhancing the accessibility of legal information and facilitating cross-jurisdictional understanding [8, 15, 18]. However, challenges remain in addressing cultural nuances and legal terminology differences, which require further research and refinement.

The integration of legal reasoning and societal values into LLMs is another critical area explored in this survey. The "Law Informs Code" approach offers a promising framework for aligning AI behavior with human goals by embedding legal knowledge and reasoning into AI systems [9]. However, the practical implementation of this methodology poses challenges, particularly in embedding complex legal reasoning and ensuring alignment with societal values.

Ethical considerations are paramount in the deployment of LLMs in legal contexts. Issues such as bias, fairness, data privacy, and accountability must be addressed to ensure the responsible use of these technologies [6]. The survey emphasizes the need for community-driven efforts and open-access models to advance the field while maintaining ethical standards.

In conclusion, while significant progress has been made in the application of LLMs to legal texts, numerous challenges and research gaps remain. Future research should focus on enhancing domain-specific adaptations, improving multilingual capabilities, integrating legal reasoning, and addressing ethical concerns. By doing so, LLMs have the potential to revolutionize legal practice, making it more efficient, accessible, and aligned with societal values. As the field continues to evolve, collaboration between NLP researchers and legal professionals will be crucial in realizing the full potential of LLMs in the legal domain.
