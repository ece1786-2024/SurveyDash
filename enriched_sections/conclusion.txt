In this survey, we have explored the transformative potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the legal domain, highlighting both the advancements and challenges that accompany their application. The integration of LLMs into legal text analysis offers significant opportunities to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of legal processes. However, it also necessitates careful consideration of domain-specific adaptations, multilingual capabilities, and ethical implications.

Our review of domain-specific language models, such as AraLegal-BERT, underscores the importance of tailoring LLMs to the unique linguistic and contextual nuances of legal texts [1]. These models demonstrate superior performance in legal tasks compared to their general-purpose counterparts, suggesting a promising direction for future research and development. Furthermore, the exploration of multilingual and cross-lingual capabilities reveals the potential for LLMs to bridge linguistic barriers in legal systems, facilitating more inclusive and comprehensive legal analyses [8, 15, 18].

Ethical considerations, particularly concerning biases inherent in LLMs, remain a critical area of concern. The findings from studies on biases against marginalized groups and the "Law Informs Code" approach emphasize the need for robust frameworks to ensure fairness and justice in legal applications [6, 9]. Addressing these biases is essential for the responsible deployment of LLMs in legal contexts and for maintaining public trust in AI-driven legal systems.

Looking ahead, the future of LLM applications in legal texts is poised for continued innovation. The challenges identified, such as improving model accuracy, handling diverse legal systems, and ensuring ethical AI use, present opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration and technological advancement [3, 7, 13]. As LLMs become increasingly integrated into legal practice, their impact on the profession and society at large will be profound, potentially reshaping how legal services are delivered and accessed.

In conclusion, the survey highlights the interconnectedness of domain-specific models, multilingual capabilities, and ethical considerations in advancing the field of legal NLP. By addressing these themes collectively, researchers and practitioners can contribute to the development of more effective, equitable, and transparent legal systems. The insights gained from this survey provide a foundation for future research and underscore the importance of ongoing dialogue between the legal and AI communities to harness the full potential of LLMs in the legal domain.
